# Colorflood

Little game using React for learning purposes.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## How to play

Click on a color under the "Selected color" menu, it will changes the colors of squares having the same color as the one at the top left. The objective is to fill the board with a single color. You can go back to specific moves to see if you can beat a random generated board in less or more moves.

`yarn build`
